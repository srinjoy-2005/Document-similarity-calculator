"""
Edit Distance Similarity — Levenshtein-based text similarity.

Computes the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings and
converts it to a similarity score:
    similarity = 1 - (edit_distance / max_length)

A score of 1.0 means the texts are identical; 0.0 means completely
different (edit distance equals the length of the longer string).
